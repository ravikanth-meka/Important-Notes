Basics:
Thread - A thread is a thread of execution in a program. 
         JVM allows an application to have multiple threads of execution running concurrently.

There are three ways to create a new thread of execution. 
1) One is to declare a class to be a subclass of Thread. This subclass should override the run method of class Thread. 
   An instance of the subclass can then be allocated and started.
   Thread is in package - java.lang
   public class Thread extends Object implements Runnable
   
2) The other way to create a thread is to declare a class that implements the Runnable interface. 
   That class then implements the run method. An instance of the class can then be allocated, passed as an argument when creating Thread,
   and started. 
   Runnable is in package - java.lang
   @FunctionalInterface
   public interface Runnable

3) The Callable interface is similar to Runnable, in that both are designed for classes whose instances are potentially executed by 
   another thread. A Runnable, however, does not return a result and cannot throw a checked exception.
   Callable is part of package - java.util.concurrent
   @FunctionalInterface
   public interface Callable<V>
   

1) Example of creation of Thread:

class PrimeThread extends Thread {
         long minPrime;
         PrimeThread(long minPrime) {
             this.minPrime = minPrime;
         }

         public void run() {
             // compute primes larger than minPrime
              . . .
         }
     }
     
    class MainThread{
      public static void main(String[] args)
      {
          PrimeThread p = new PrimeThread(143);
          p.start();
      }
    }

2) Example of creation of Thread using Runnable:
 class PrimeRun implements Runnable {
         long minPrime;
         PrimeRun(long minPrime) {
             this.minPrime = minPrime;
         }

         public void run() {
             // compute primes larger than minPrime
              . . .
         }
     }
      class MainThread{
      public static void main(String[] args)
      {
         PrimeRun p = new PrimeRun(143);
         new Thread(p).start();
      }
    }
    
    3) Example of creation of Thread using Callable:
    
    Here is a simple example of Java Callable task that returns the name of thread executing the task after one second. 
    We are using Executor framework to execute task and use Java Future to get the result of the submitted tasks.
    
    class PrimeCallable implements Callable {
         long minPrime;
         PrimeRun(long minPrime) {
             this.minPrime = minPrime;
         }

         @Override
         public String call() throws Exception {
              Thread.sleep(1000);
              //return the thread name executing this callable task
              return Thread.currentThread().getName();
         }
     }
    
    public class MyCallable  {
    public static void main(String args[]){
        ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(10);
        Callable<String> callable = new MyCallable();
        Future<String> future = executor.submit(callable);
        System.out.println(new Date()+ "::"+future.get());
    }
}
